# 🔥 Fire Escape Route Agent using AI Search Algorithms

## 📌 Project Overview

“Fire Escape Route Agent” is a pathfinding problem, which studies and aims to the find the fastest and most safe path to take in a mall in case of a fire. The environment of the study is a 3D maze of size 25x30 and the actor is an agent that routes the maze through different AI algorithms in order to find the fastest and most safe path to the goal and select the AI algorithm that led it to this path in the shortest time as the best algorithm. Depending on the results of the study, a Surviving Trolley that transports people will take the optimal path towards the exit of the mall safely.

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Breadth First Search (BFS)**       | Tries to reach the goal by exploring all neighboring nodes level by level |
| **Depth First Search (DFS)**         | Explores one path deeply before backtracking                              |
| **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)** | Combines DFS depth limits with BFS completeness                           |
| **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**        | Expands the node with the lowest cumulative cost                          |
| **A* Search**                        | Uses path cost and heuristic function to efficiently reach the goal       |
| **Hill Climbing**                    | Greedy approach that selects the closest neighbor to the goal             |

## 🏆 Algorithm Ranking (Best → Worst)

Based on **path optimality, exploration efficiency, and suitability for emergency evacuation**, the algorithms are ranked as follows:

1. **A*** – Optimal path with heuristic guidance
2. **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** – Optimal but impractical for real-time fire escape scenarios
3. **Breadth First Search (BFS)** – Optimal path but inefficient for fire escape scenarios
4. **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)** – Complete but inefficient in large environments
5. **Depth First Search (DFS)** – Fast but non-optimal
6. **Hill Climbing** – Incomplete
